# 🎵 Roulettify - Spotify Multiplayer Game

A real-time multiplayer web game where players guess which friend has listened to randomly selected tracks the most, based on their Spotify listening history.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Authenticate** with Spotify
2. **Join one of 3 persistent rooms** (max 6 players per room)
3. **Listen** to 30-second track previews
4. **Guess** which player has that track ranked highest in their top 50
5. **Earn points** for correct guesses (10 pts + 5 pts speed bonus)
6. **Compete** across 10 rounds to become the champion

## ✨ Features

- **Spotify OAuth2 Integration**: Securely authenticate and fetch your top 50 tracks
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: WebSocket-powered live game updates
- **3 Persistent Rooms**: Always-available game rooms (Room 1, Room 2, Room 3)
- **Capacity Management**: Max 6 players per room (18 concurrent players total)
- **Audio Previews**: 30-second Spotify track snippets for each round (scraped from embeds)
- **Dynamic Scoring**: 10 base points + 5 bonus for fastest correct guess
- **Persistent Rankings**: Tracks final standings and winner announcement
- **Optimized Architecture**: Persistent rooms with no cleanup overhead for efficient hosting

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Backend

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### REST

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/` | Health check |
| GET | `/health` | Detailed metrics |
| GET | `/rooms` | List all 3 persistent rooms with player counts |
| GET | `/auth/spotify` | Start Spotify OAuth |
| GET | `/auth/callback` | OAuth callback |

### WebSocket (`/ws`)

**Client → Server**:

```json
{
  "type": "join_room",
  "payload": {
    "room_id": "Room 1",
    "player_id": "user123",
    "player_name": "John",
    "access_token": "spotify_token"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "start_game",
  "payload": {
    "room_id": "Room 1",
    "total_rounds": 10
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "submit_guess",
  "payload": {
    "room_id": "Room 1",
    "player_id": "user123",
    "guessed_player_id": "friend456"
  }
}
```

**Server → Client**:

```json
{
  "type": "player_joined",
  "payload": {
    "players": [...],
    "player_count": 2
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "round_started",
  "payload": {
    "round": 1,
    "total_rounds": 10,
    "track": {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Song Name",
      "artists": ["Artist 1"],
      "image_url": "...",
      "preview_url": "..."
    },
    "players": [...]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "round_complete",
  "payload": {
    "round": 1,
    "winner_id": "user123",
    "winner_rank": 5,
    "correct_guessers": ["user123"],
    "points_awarded": {"user123": 15},
    "updated_scores": {"user123": 15, "friend456": 0}
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "game_over",
  "payload": {
    "winner_id": "user123",
    "final_scores": {"user123": 85, "friend456": 60}
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Scoring System

| Event | Points |
|-------|--------|
| Correct guess | +10 |
| Speed bonus (fastest) | +5 |
| Wrong guess | 0 |

**Winner Determination**: The player whose top 50 contains the track with the **lowest rank number** (most listened to) wins the round.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mardon3/roulettify.git
cd roulettify

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Spotify credentials

# Run with hot reload (installs air if needed)
make watch

# Or run manually
make run
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
make docker-run

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Test for race conditions
make test-race
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Server
PORT=8080
APP_ENV=development

# Frontend
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Spotify (Get from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/auth/callback

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173

# Game Settings
DEFAULT_TOTAL_ROUNDS=10
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM=6
```

### Spotify Developer Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`
5. For production, add your production URL to redirect URIs

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Persistent Room System
- **3 fixed rooms** (Room 1, Room 2, Room 3) created at startup
- **6 player capacity** per room (18 total concurrent players)
- **No dynamic creation/deletion** - rooms never shut down
- **Memory efficient** - optimized for low-memory cloud deployments
- **Consistent ordering** - rooms always appear in the same order in UI

### Preview URL Strategy
As of Nov 2024, Spotify no longer provides preview URLs via API for new applications. This project uses web scraping:
- Fetches Spotify embed pages for each track
- Extracts preview URLs using regex patterns
- Implements caching to reduce scraping overhead
- Falls back gracefully when previews unavailable

## 📊 Performance

- **Memory**: 3 persistent rooms
- **Concurrent Users**: Up to 18 (6 per room)
- **WebSocket Connections**: Persistent per player
- **Latency**: <100ms for game actions
- **Deployment**: Minimal resource usage
